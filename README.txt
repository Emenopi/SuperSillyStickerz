Introduction

'Super Silly Stickerz' is a website that sells pre-made and customisable stickers. It allows users to login, browse, customise, and purchase stickers.

The home page displays all pre-made stickers which can be filtered by categories which appear in the sidebar.

Once the user has chosen a sticker they wish to purchase, they can then choose the finish of the sticker from the available options, and the quantity they wish to purchase.

There is also an option to buy custom stickers. This functionality allows users to make a unique sticker by uploading an image. Users can also select finish and quantity for custom stickers.

In order to purchase a sticker, the user must have an account and be logged in.

There is also a dashboard page where users can view their order history and view/edit their shipping and billing information.
